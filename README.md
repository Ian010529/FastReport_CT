# FastReport_CT

FastReport_CT is a full-stack application for generating, reviewing, and tracking telecom customer reports.

The current stack uses:

- `Next.js` for the frontend
- `Spring Boot` + `JdbcTemplate` for the backend
- `PostgreSQL` for persistence
- `RabbitMQ` for asynchronous job delivery and retry
- `Server-Sent Events (SSE)` for real-time report status updates
- A pluggable LLM provider layer for report generation

## Branches

| Branch | Description |
|---|---|
| `master` | Stable release branch |
| `v0.5` | Current development branch |

## Overview

Current flow:

1. The user submits a report request from the frontend.
2. The backend validates the payload and runs duplicate-detection checks.
3. If the request is valid, the backend stores the report and returns `202 Accepted`.
4. The backend publishes a RabbitMQ job for asynchronous processing.
5. The frontend opens an SSE connection for the new report.
6. A Spring Boot worker consumes the RabbitMQ job.
7. The worker calls the configured LLM provider to generate the report.
8. The worker updates report status in PostgreSQL to `processing`, `completed`, or `failed`.
9. The worker publishes a result event to a RabbitMQ result queue.
10. The backend listens for the result event and pushes it to connected SSE clients.

## Features

### Report Workspace

- Page: `/`
- Presents a responsive English-language workspace for report operations
- Separates report creation, feedback, and recent report monitoring into reusable UI sections
- Accepts customer, manager, service, spending, complaint, network-quality, and override-reason input
- Stores the request immediately
- Publishes an async RabbitMQ job
- Returns `202 Accepted` with `pending` status

### Validation and Duplicate Detection

The backend validates incoming report requests before inserting data or publishing a RabbitMQ job.

Validation checks include:

- required fields
- type and null checks for array values
- format checks for `customerId`, `managerId`, and `nationalId`
- dictionary checks for `serviceCode`

Duplicate-detection rules include:

- same `customer_id` + different `national_id` -> `BLOCK`
- same `manager_id` + different `manager_name` -> `BLOCK`
- same customer + same service + same day -> `BLOCK`
- same customer + same service + different day -> `WARNING`
- same `national_id` + different `customer_id` -> `WARNING`

If a warning is triggered and `overrideReason` is missing, the backend rejects the request.

### Unified Error Handling

The backend uses a unified exception system with:

- `BaseAppException`
- `ValidationError`
- `BlockError`
- `WarningException`
- `@RestControllerAdvice` for consistent JSON error responses

Error response format:

```json
{
  "type": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
  "code": "INVALID_CUSTOMER_ID",
  "message": "customerId must be exactly 8 digits.",
  "detail": {},
  "httpStatus": 400
}
```

The frontend API layer parses this structure into a typed `ApiError`, so UI code can branch on `type` and `code` instead of raw message text.

### Asynchronous Report Generation

- Background processing is handled by a Spring Boot worker
- Worker status transitions:
  - `pending`
  - `processing`
  - `completed`
  - `failed`
- If the LLM call fails, the job is retried up to 3 times
- On completion or final failure, the worker publishes a result event

### LLM Provider Abstraction

- `ReportGenerationService` builds the report prompt and delegates generation through `LLMServiceFactory`
- `LLMServiceFactory` selects the active provider from configuration
- `OpenAICompatibleLLMService` supports OpenAI-style Chat Completions endpoints
- `ClaudeLLMService` shows how to support a second provider without changing report-generation business logic
- Switching providers is configuration-driven through `llm.provider`

### Real-Time Status Updates via SSE

- The frontend opens an SSE connection to `GET /api/reports/{id}/events`
- `ReportResultListener` consumes result events from RabbitMQ
- `ReportSseService` manages per-report SSE emitters
- The frontend updates the UI when a result event is received

### Retry Strategy

RabbitMQ retry is implemented with delayed retry queues and dead-letter routing.

Retry schedule:

- Retry 1: 5 seconds
- Retry 2: 10 seconds
- Retry 3: 20 seconds

Each report gets:

- 1 initial processing attempt
- up to 3 retries
- 4 total attempts at most

### Report Query and Detail View

- `GET /api/reports` lists report history
- `GET /api/reports/{id}` returns one report
- Detail page: `/report/{id}`

### Export

Completed reports can be downloaded as:

- TXT
- PDF
- CSV

## Frontend UX

The current frontend is structured as a responsive report workspace with reusable UI primitives such as section cards, feedback banners, page headers, and status badges.

The create form distinguishes error types instead of only showing a raw message:

- `VALIDATION_ERROR` -> red feedback panel + field highlighting
- `BLOCK` -> red feedback panel + conflict field highlighting
- `WARNING` -> amber feedback panel + `overrideReason` highlighting
- successful submission -> green feedback panel

This keeps frontend control flow stable even if backend wording changes.

## API Summary

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/reports` | Create a report and enqueue async generation |
| GET | `/api/reports` | List reports |

| GET | `/api/reports/{id}/events` | Open SSE stream for report updates |
| GET | `/api/reports/{id}/download?format=txt\|pdf\|csv` | Download report content |

### Example Create Request

```json
{
  "customerId": "10000001",
  "customerName": "Zhang San",
  "nationalId": "110101199003077758",
  "managerName": "Manager Li",
  "managerId": "200001",
  "serviceCode": "FTTH_500M",
  "currentPlan": "Integrated Plan 199",
  "additionalServices": ["Cloud Disk", "IPTV"],
  "spendingLast6": [199, 199, 210, 185, 199, 220],
  "complaintHistory": ["2024-12 Slow broadband speed", "2025-01 Slow customer service response"],
  "networkQuality": "Download speed occasionally drops below 50% of subscribed bandwidth",
  "overrideReason": "Confirmed by operator after manual review"
}
```

### Example Success Response

```json
{
  "id": 12,
  "status": "pending",
  "message": "Report accepted. It will be generated in the background."
}
```

### Example Warning Response

```json
{
  "type": "WARNING",
  "code": "OVERRIDE_REASON_REQUIRED",
  "message": "Override reason is required for warning cases.",
  "detail": {
    "warnings": ["Same nationalId exists under a different customerId."]
  },
  "httpStatus": 409
}
```

## Data Model

Main tables:

- `customers`
- `managers`
- `reports`
- `spending_history`
- `complaints`
- `network_quality`

The backend stores all input rows in PostgreSQL and later writes the generated care plan back into `reports.report_content`.

## Local Setup

### 1. Prepare Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

### 2. Start the Default Stack

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Services:

- Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Backend: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- PostgreSQL: `localhost:5432`
- RabbitMQ AMQP: `localhost:5672`
- RabbitMQ Management UI: [http://localhost:15672](http://localhost:15672)

Default credentials:

- PostgreSQL database: `fastreport`
- PostgreSQL user: `fastreport`
- PostgreSQL password: `fastreport123`
- RabbitMQ user: `fastreport`
- RabbitMQ password: `fastreport123`

## Debug Mode

Use:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.debug.yml up --build
```

Debug mode adds:

- backend Java remote debug on port `5005`
- frontend `next dev` mode
- bind-mounted frontend source for easier breakpoint debugging

VSCode helpers are already included in:

- `.vscode/launch.json`
- `.vscode/tasks.json`

## How the Async Worker Works

The async components are:

- `ReportController`: accepts requests and returns success responses
- `ReportApplicationService`: validates input, checks duplicates, persists report data, and publishes jobs
- `ReportJobPublisher`: sends initial and retry messages to RabbitMQ
- `RabbitConfig`: declares queues, exchanges, and bindings
- `ReportWorker`: consumes report jobs
- `ReportGenerationService`: loads report data, calls the LLM, and updates database status
- `ReportResultPublisher`: publishes result events
- `ReportResultListener`: forwards result events to SSE clients
- `ReportSseService`: manages active emitters by report ID

## How to Verify RabbitMQ and the Worker

### Option 1: RabbitMQ Management UI

Open:

- [http://localhost:15672](http://localhost:15672)

Login with:

- username: `fastreport`
- password: `fastreport123`

Queues include:

- `report.generate.queue`
- `report.generate.retry.1.queue`
- `report.generate.retry.2.queue`
- `report.generate.retry.3.queue`
- `report.result.queue`

### Option 2: Backend Logs

```bash
docker compose logs -f backend
```

Typical log sequence:

- report created
- job published
- worker picked message
- LLM call started
- report completed or retry scheduled

### Option 3: Database Check

```bash
docker compose exec db psql -U fastreport -d fastreport -c "select id, status, updated_at from reports order by id desc limit 10;"
```

## Current Limitations

- No authentication or authorization
- No persistent audit table for override reasons or retry history
- Duplicate checks still rely on current schema and `created_at` date logic
- No Flyway or Liquibase migration management yet
- No dedicated automated test suite for validation and error branches yet
